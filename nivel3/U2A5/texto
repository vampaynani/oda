Two heavy *doors* at the end of the hallway open
suddenly. The dining room is full of light. There is a long
*table* with big, soft chairs around it. There are some
trees growing in the room, there is a waterfall.

The air is full of delicious smells--roasted turkey, soup,
vegetables, homemade bread and cherry pie.

Paul's *stomach* growls. He's hungry!

The king sits at the end of the table and invites the 
children to sit down next to him.

A golden *fountain* in the middle of the table starts to flow.
Musicians with *flutes* enter the room and start to play
a beautiful tune.

Servants serve the food to the king and the children.
Paul takes a drink from his *cup*.

The clear liquid is cool and sweet.

"It's delicious!" he says.

"It's the water that collects in the flowers at night" says
the king, "it tastes sweet, just like the *flowers*! The
unicorns and dragons help us collect the water from the
flowers."

Megan remembers Amedrah, the purple dragon. "Is there
a way for us to get back home?" she asks the king.

"Yes, of course. You can leave at any time. Just close your 
*eyes* and imagine that Amedrah is flying here. But
you and Paul are here for a good reason. You have an
important *question* to ask me!"

Megan looks at Paul. How does the king know? Megan
says, "You're right- Our town, Lakeville, is in *trouble*.
We need yor help."
