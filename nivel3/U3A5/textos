It's a beatufil fall day in Lakeville. The ***** are full
of bright red and yellow leaves. There are apples,
peaches and pears on the trees. Paul and Megan are 
standing nextto the ****, which is full of clear blue
water. They are planting a tree. A cool **** blows
gently. Megan remembers the Kingdom of Waters.

"Things are very different now, aren't they?" she says
to Paul.

"A lot of things are different. There's water now for
all the plants and ********," he says.

"For us, too," Megan adds.

The wind blows again. Paul remembers flying with
Amedrah, looking at the lakes and rivers of the
Kingdom of Waters. "Too bad Amerah the dragon

can't visit us here. I want to fly on his **** above
Lakeville and see the lake from the air. I bet it looks
beautiful!"

They take the Magic Rain Book out of Paul's
*****. They look at the book's cover. in the
bright *******, they see something new and
surprising. The little says, "The Kigndom of Waters."
Under the title, it says, "Imagine it is your *****!"

"I have an idea," Megan says. "Let's imagine that
Amedrah the dragon is here with us in our world!"

The kids close their ****. The wind starts blowing.
The kids look up. A purple dragon appears in the
clear blue ***. Paul and Megan look at each other
and smile.
